    I am apart of a Cal Poly, Graphic Communication chapter called TAGA, also known as the Technical Association of the Graphic Arts.<br> <br>Our chapter writes, prints, binds and manufactures several technical journals that get presented then judged by industry professionals at a specific location each year. This year, we had 7 members of our chapter travel to Memphis Tennessee to represent our school at the TAGA Conference.<br><br>TAGA raised over $5,000 and spent over 150 hours working on our &ldquo;Evolution of Print&rdquo; themed journal. In 2016, our Cal Poly chapter took second place at the TAGA national conference!</p>
